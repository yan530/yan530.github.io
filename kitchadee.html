    <h2>Problem Statment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Who: Average American Households
        <ul>
          <li>roughly $2.2k worth of food is wasted every year</li>
          <li>Overbuying food</li>
          <li>Expired Food</li>
          <li>Food not stored properly</li>
          <li>Lack of planning</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What: Food Waste
        <ul>
          <li>40% of the food is wasted annually in the US</li>
          <li>40-50% of the wasted food come from consumers</li>
          <li>20% of the wastes in landfill is food</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why: Wasteful
        <ul>
          <li>Economically, the amount of money wasted on food could have been
            put to better use. It also make the price of food more expensive.</li>
            <li>Environmentally, food wastes in landfill creates large amount of
              methan which could lead to global warming and climate change. It also
              wasted the resources we used to grow and make food.</li>
              <li>Ethically, 1 in 6 Americans are food insecure, meaning they lack
                access to enough food. Wastng food is "luxury" and it's our duty to
                take care of those who's in need</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>Our project focused mainly on average American Households.
            <ul>
              <li>Family with kids</li>
              <li>Young couple</li>
              <li>Elderly</li>
              <li>People who live alone</li>
              <li>College students who share a house</li>
            </ul>
            We divided the
            researach into three parts:online survey, interviews and observation.
            <ul>

              <!-- survey -->
              <li>
                <h4>Here's a list of questions we asked and what we found:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>How often do you go grocery shopping?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>Most of the respondents purchase groceries once a week,
                      or more frequently. 13.5% purchase groceries twice a month, and one outlier purchases groceries less
                      than once a month. Interesting, only 13.5% of the people said they never
                      overbuy food. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>How often do you find expired food in your fridge?</strong>
                      <br>
                      <p>8.1% of the people said never. 64.9% of the food wastes come from
                        fruits and vegetables. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li> <strong>How much money is wasted annually on food in your household?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>Surprisingly, majority of the family gave an number that was below
                          average("better-than-average effect"). In fact, only 19.4% of people
                          think they waste more than average. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Do you throw out products on the sell-by date?</strong>
                          <br>
                          <p>56.8% said they throw out some of the expired food, while 40.5%
                            said they do not for any products.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Do you use any products to limit food wastes?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <p>Below is a bar graph of what we found:</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>Majority of them responded "yes". 80% said they prefer it affordable
                              and 56% prefer it environmental friendly.</p>

                      Conclusion: People don't usually keep track of what they have and tend to
                      overbuy groceries. Even if the food is about to expire, people don't pay attention
                      until they have to throw it out. People might also throw away food because it's
                      not desirable anymore. Most people are aware of food waste, but they're not aware of
                      how much food is wasted. According to "better-than-average effect",
                      people tend to believe that their performances are above average, but in fact,
                      they're not. Unfortunately, reducing food waste is not the #1 problem
                      for many people. our goal is to find a cheaper, greener and
                      more convenient solution.

                    <h2>Stakeholder Analysis</h2>
                    <p>My team had identified few stakeholders: families, grocery stores, organizations
                      and RFID chip companies. But I think there're more than we could imagine. I
                      made a chart that contains four section. Each stakeholder is placed on
                      a section according to their interests and power. I also color coded
                      each them based on their benefits. Red means not beneficial and green means beneficial.
                      Here's the plot:
                    </p>
                    <img src="image/stakeholder.png" alt="stakeholders">
                    <p> Those who are most beneficial: Large families, elderly and college students.
                      Those who are most unbeneficial: grocery stores, food processing companies,
                      restaurants and fast food restaurants.

                      <li>
                        <strong>Large families:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>Save food wastes definitly save a lot of money for them
                          because they buys more food than other family and it's more
                          likely they have a hard time manage food items at home.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Elderly:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>They might not buy too much food themselves, but since
                          we're focusing on average American household, they might
                          make large meals for their grandchildren and they consumes
                          less calories.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>College Students:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <p>They ususally want to save money and enjoy food at
                          the same time. Some of them might have a hard time
                          doing grocery shopping because of too much homework.
                          Others might have too much leftovers from parties and
                          pizza nights. Many colleges offer buffet style
                          meal plan, so they might not finish all their food.

                         <br>
                         <p>Less grocery shopping means less profit for the
                           grocery stores. They might not be strongly against
                           the idea of reducing food waste, but the solution
                           could reduce their sales too.

                       <li><strong>Food Processing Companies:</strong>
                         <br>
                         <p>If the needs go down, the amount of production goes down
                           at the same time, which means less revenue. Food
                           processing companies might not like this idea.
                         </p>
                       </li>
                       <li><strong>Restaurants and Fast Food Restaurants:</strong>
                         <br>
                         <p>Less food waste means people will either eat what
                           they get or get what they can eat. People might want
                           smaller portions from the restaurants and if there's
                           no small portion, they might just cook at home.
